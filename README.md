# Digital business card

It's a bussiness digital card built with ReactJS and styled with custom CSS. Its completely static and could have well been built with just HTML and CSS as there is no any interaction going on. But its all i needed to familiarise myself with React's so-called "thinking in components"

The project was bootstrapped with Vite.
